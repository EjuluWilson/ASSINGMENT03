/**
 * @file TextAnalysisAppBST.cpp
 * .............................Program Functionality...........................................
 *
 * Main program for analyzing text files. This program reads a list of filenames from an input file,
 * processes each file to identify all distinct words (treating words case-insensitively and considering
 * hyphenated words as single entities), and compiles them into a binary search tree (BST) to track their
 * frequency of occurrence. It then outputs each file's distinct words, their frequencies, and the number of
 * probes required for insertion/search into a BST, to an output file in alphabetical order. Each file's
 * analysis starts with the file name, followed by the maximum and average number of probes, and ends with a separator line.

/**
 *...............................Input/Output Format.......................................
 *
 * Input - The program takes as input a text file named 'input.txt', containing a list of filenames. Each filename
 * is provided on a new line and includes the relative path to the file.
 *
 * Output - The program outputs to a file named 'output.txt', which starts with the author's ID ("wejulu"), followed by
 * the analysis of each file. For each file, it lists the filename, maximum and average number of probes, the distinct
 * words in alphabetical order with their frequency of occurrence, and ends with a separator line of dashes.
 */

/* 
 *......................... Solution Strategy (pseudocode).....................................
 *
 * The program utilizes the following approach to analyze text files and track word occurrences:
 * 1. Read the list of filenames from 'input.txt'.
 * 2. For each filename:
 *    a. Open the file and read its contents line by line.
 *    b. For each line, process it to identify distinct words, taking care of case-insensitivity, hyphenated words,
 *       and ignoring apostrophes followed by 's'.
 *    c. Insert each distinct word into a BST, or increment its frequency if it already exists.
 * 3. After all words are inserted, traverse the BST in-order to output the words in alphabetical order, along with
 *    their frequency, and compute the maximum and average number of probes.
 * 4. Write the analysis for the file to 'output.txt', including the filename, the max and average probes, and the
 *    list of words with their frequencies.
 * 5. Repeat the process for each file listed in 'input.txt'.

/*
 * .........................Text File Analyzer Testing Summary .............................
 *
 * A comprehensive series of tests were conducted on the Text File Analyzer to ensure its functionality under a wide
 * array of scenarios, ranging from simple to complex. These tests were designed to validate the program's ability to
 * read filenames, process text files for distinct words, correctly use a BST for tracking occurrences, and accurately
 * output the analysis.
 * 
 * Test Scenarios that the program was exposed to:
 * - Basic Functionality: Confirmed the application's ability to correctly identify and count unique words.
 * - Case Insensitivity: Validated that words are treated case-insensitively, ensuring consistent word counting.
 * - Handling Hyphenated Words and Apostrophes: Tested the program's capability to correctly process hyphenated words
 *   as single entities and to ignore apostrophes followed by 's'.
 * - Efficiency with Large Datasets: Assessed performance with inputs containing a large number of words, ensuring
 *   the BST maintains efficient operation.
 * - Edge Cases: Verified the program's handling of files with no words, files with a single word repeated, and files
 *   with complex punctuation scenarios.
 * - Accuracy in Probe Calculation: Ensured that the maximum and average number of probes for word insertion/search
 *   are correctly calculated and reported.
 * 
 * Outcomes:
 * - The application successfully analyzed text files according to the specified criteria in all tested scenarios.
 * - Demonstrated robust performance and accuracy, efficiently processing files, identifying unique words, and
 *   correctly calculating probe metrics.
 * - Proved its capability to handle various edge cases, confirming the program's comprehensive error handling and
 *   adaptability to different input formats.

/*
 * .........................Complexity Analysis......................................................
 * The algorithm's time complexity primarily depends on the operations performed on the BST (insertion and in-order traversal).
 * 
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(n) for storing unique words in the BST, where n is the number of distinct words in all files. The space required grows
 *   linearly with the number of unique words encountered.
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(m log n) for inserting words into the BST, where m is the total number of words read and n is the number of distinct
 *   words. This is for a balanced BST; however, in the worst case of an unbalanced tree, this could degrade to O(mn).
 * - O(n) for the in-order traversal of the BST to output words in alphabetical order.
 * 
 * The overall efficiency of the algorithm is highly dependent on the structure of the BST, with the potential for optimization
 * through self-balancing trees to ensure O(m log n) performance consistently.
